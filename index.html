    <p class="contact-message">Hyapatia suffers from a rare condition known as panhypopituitarism, a complete lack of pituitary gland functions. As the pituitary gland is the master gland, this condition is life-threatening for several reasons. There is no cure. Contributions towards Hyapatia's Go Fund Me are always greatly appreciated.</p>
